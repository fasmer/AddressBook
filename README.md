# AddressBook

This is a simple Address Book program utilizing ArrayLists. The user has four options on main menu: 
1. Enter new contact
2. Print address book
3. Search for contact
4. Exit

Two classes: AddressBookMain (where the bulk of the code is) and ContactInformation which sets the blueprint for the contact objects 
that are held in the ArrayList.
